**Overview**

Covid-19 is a virus that swept the world including. In this project, I was able to analysis the number of case, the total number of deaths, the number of states involved and the trend of new reports.


From the analysis, it can be seen that Lagos state had the highest number of cases as well as number of death. This can be attributed to the high population in lagos and inability to fully achieve the necessary precautions needed to halt the spread of covid-19.
